The following image shows Dec 11 (a day after the tornado), with areas of acceptable quality data (constant) highlighted in green and acceptable quality data (ephemeral) highlighted in yellow. No overlay atop the NTL data indicates that there is no up to date high quality data for those pixels, in this case showing that significant disruption remains over Mayfield on the 11th, making a day-after picture of the town impossible.\n",
